To-Train-AI-Agents-to-play-Football-in-a-Simulated-Environment

This project focuses on training AI agents to play football in a simulated environment using a 
combination of Genetic Algorithms (GAs), Deep Learning, Neural Networks, and the Pygame 
library. The problem lies in enabling AI agents to make decisions in real-time, such as passing, 
shooting, or defending, while adapting to continuously changing game scenarios. Traditional 
approaches, such as rule-based systems, fail to provide the adaptability and optimization required 
for such tasks. The solution proposed in this project integrates Genetic Algorithms and Deep 
Learning techniques to develop robust AI agents. Genetic Algorithms are employed to optimize 
the strategies and parameters of the agents, leveraging their ability to simulate evolution and 
natural selection. By incorporating both the learning capabilities of Neural Networks and the 
optimization power of GAs, the AI agents develop increasingly sophisticated strategies to play 
football effectively.The results show that this hybrid approach can produce agents that 
progressively improve their gameplay performance through continuous learning and evolution. 
In conclusion, the combination of Genetic Algorithms, Deep Learning, and Neural Networks 
offers an efficient solution for training AI agents in complex and dynamic environments like 
football. This approach not only enhances their decision-making capabilities but also opens up 
new possibilities for AI in simulations and gaming, with the potential to extend beyond football 
into other domains requiring adaptive AI behaviors.
